title: About
---

I'm a software engineer currently living in Melbourne, working remotely for
the [Psychiatry Neuromimaging Laboratory](http://pnl.bwh.harvard.edu) in Boston.
My interests are data analysis pipelines, inference, and understanding design
principles behind concise, uncomplicated software systems.
