title: About
---

I'm a software developer currently living in Melbourne, working remotely for the
[Psychiatry Neuromimaging Laboratory](http://pnl.bwh.harvard.edu) in Boston and
a startup in Canada.  My interests are data analysis pipelines and inference,
and I'm unduly obsessed with understanding design principles behind concise,
uncomplicated software systems.
