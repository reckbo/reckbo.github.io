(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation)
    To illustrate this in terms of our notation, let X = {x | x ∈ A ∧ P(x)} denotes
    the set of every element of A satisfying the predicate P(x). The canonical
    restriction on set builder notation asserts that X is a set only if A is
    already known to be a set. This restriction is codified in the axiom schema of
    separation present in standard axiomatic set theory


important aspect of defining a set is definition must enable us to determine
which objects are in the set and which aren't.
Sets are specified using one of three methods:
1) explicit listing
2) set builder notation
3) characteristic functions
