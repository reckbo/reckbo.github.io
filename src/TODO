Add some rigor to set/bit array post
let A,B \in P(G)
A U B <-> \bigcup {A,B} <-> {x \in G | x \in A OR x \in B} 
I_A : G -> {0,1} 
I_B : G -> {0,1}
I_{A U B} -> bit array

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation)
    To illustrate this in terms of our notation, let X = {x | x ∈ A ∧ P(x)} denotes
    the set of every element of A satisfying the predicate P(x). The canonical
    restriction on set builder notation asserts that X is a set only if A is
    already known to be a set. This restriction is codified in the axiom schema of
    separation present in standard axiomatic set theory
    

important aspect of defining a set is definition must enable us to determine
which objects are in the set and which aren't.
Sets are specified using one of three methods:
1) explicit listing
2) set builder notation
3) characteristic functions

Characteristic function as method of specifying a set
characteristic function Chi_A  of set A is a mapping from  objects
into membership indicators. maps object x to 0 if x is not in A,
and 1 if x is in A.
